# Seam Carver - Content-aware image resizing

An optimized and improved implementation of the [seam-carving algorithm first presented by Shamir and Avidan](http://www.faculty.idc.ac.il/arik/SCWeb/imret/imret.pdf) of Mitsubishi Labs, to create faster renders and provide real-time previews.

## Try out the GUI application

A basic GUI application is available (JavaFX + Java, packaged as an executable), that let's you try you see real-time renders from the algorithms implemented in this project. Simply click the 'Load image' button in the application and then move the slider around once the image is loaded.

> Note: Render speed varies by processing power of the computer you're using. For real-time previews, it is recommended to use an image that is no larger than 1500w x 800h
